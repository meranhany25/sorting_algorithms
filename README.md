Welcome to your one-stop shop for understanding and mastering sorting algorithms! This file is your guide to navigating the fascinating world of order and efficiency.

What is a sorting algorithm?

Simply put, a sorting algorithm is a set of instructions that arranges data in a specific order, like ascending or descending. This seemingly basic task underpins countless applications, from organizing your music library to powering search engines.

Why big O matters:

Big O notation helps us understand the performance of an algorithm based on its resource usage (usually time or space). Understanding big O allows you to choose the right algorithm for the job, ensuring your applications run smoothly and efficiently.
